The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCB2300 Board 
using a NXP LPC23xx Microcontroller.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 288 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK =  48 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  12 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

File manipulation from the target is also available over COM Port.

When INT0 button is pressed the USB Memory is unmounted from the PC
and can be accessed from the target over COM1 Port. It allows to create,
read, copy, delete files and format the card. Pressing INT0 button
again will re-mount the USB Memory on the PC.

Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM1 port using HyperTerminal
  at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, No Flow Control.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  MCB2300:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
              (used for production or target debugging)

Note: 
  for Vers.3 board set:
    - jumper J5 (UMODE) to 1[2 3] for USB soft connect
    - jumper J1 (D-) on 
    - jumper J2 (D+) on
  for Vers.4 board set:
    - jumper J5 (UMODE) to 1[2 3] for USB soft connect
    - jumper D- to [1 2]3 
    - jumper D+ to [1 2]3
